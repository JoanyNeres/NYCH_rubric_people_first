One of the most fulfilling experiences of my life is volunteering. As an immigrant myself, having the chance to use my skills to help other newcomers is priceless. Since moving to Canada, I have been part of the North York Community House, a neighbourhood center supporting Toronto newcomers for the last 30 years. They offer a wide variety of programs to help children, youth, adults and seniors to settle, thrive and belong in their lives in Canada.

This form is part of a course that will help others NYCH collaborators identify how to conduct and develop programs to attend the community.

I made this form using react to calculate the score of answers and display a corresponding result to the user.

A sweet alert will display if the user forget to fill the persona's name or to answer some question.

And these are the results displayed when the score is calculated.
